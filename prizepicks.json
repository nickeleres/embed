I also loved their promos with matching deposits and upping their winning scales allowing you to win 10x your spread. However this good thing turned sour once their payment method kept changing. At first all you had to do was deposit through the app, then it was if you use Mastercard you must deposit through PayPal with it. I had no problem with either but now all a sudden Mastercard isn\u2019t accepted which takes away money from thousands of users like me that don\u2019t enjoy using 3rd and 4th party apps to deposit and withdraw money. I shouldn\u2019t have to go all around the world just to make a deposit and PayPal doesn\u2019t make it any better. PayPal will have your cards linked but will only accept your entire bank being linked just to add money to PayPal.

With this app, placing a $5 bet means that the initial $5 is kept by the house even if you win. This makes the odds absolutely atrocious. On the simple and most reliable bet type (3 player flex play) the odds of hitting a wining bet are 50/50. A classic bet on 50/50 should have an average payout of about $4.50. Because this app keeps your initial bet money the average payout on a 50/50 bet is $1.25 \ud83e\udd22. Imagine if I offered you a coin flip where a loss equals -$5 and a win equals +$1.25. The worst part is they don\u2019t even have to use this system. If they respected the risk-reward system where you receive your initial bet back it would still average only +$3.75 for a win.
